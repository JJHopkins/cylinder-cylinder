Manuscript: Implementation of the fully retarded solutions for anisotropic cylinders in Gecko Hamaker 

Methods:
Give and explain (with math) the equations for Hamaker coefficients A0 and A2 in terms of the LDS, cylinder radius, angle, and separation. 

Discussion (probably): (we intend to report only Hamaker coefficients explicitly) 
How to calculate normal force and torque from these Hamaker coefficients 

Provide citation papers:
Papers that describe the importance of understanding these torques that we could cite for this
